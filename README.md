## dbt models for `jaffle_shop`

`jaffle_shop` is a fictional ecommerce store. This dbt project transforms raw
data from an app database into a customers and orders model ready for analytics.

The raw data from the app consists of customers, orders, and payments, with the
following entity-relationship diagram:

### Using this project as a tutorial
To get up and running with this project:
1. Install dbt using [these instructions](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/installation).

2. Clone this repository. If you need extra help, see [these instructions](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/use-an-existing-project).

3. Change into the `jaffle_shop` directory from the command line:
```bash
$ cd jaffle_shop
```

4. Set up a profile called `dbt_training` to connect to a data warehouse by
  following [these instructions](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/configure-your-profile).
  If you have access to a data warehouse, you can use those credentials â€“ we
  recommend setting your [target schema](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/configure-your-profile#section-populating-your-profile)
  to be a new schema (dbt will create the schema for you, as long as you have
  the right priviliges). If you don't have access to an existing data warehouse,
  you can also setup a local postgres database and connect to it in your profile.

5. Ensure your profile is setup correctly from the command line:
```bash
$ dbt debug
```

6. Load the CSVs with the demo data set. This materializes the CSVs as tables in
  your target schema. Note that a typical dbt project **does not require this
  step** since dbt assumes your raw data is already in your warehouse.
```bash
$ dbt seed
```

7. Run the models:
```bash
$ dbt run
```

> **NOTE:** If this steps fails, it might be that you need to make small changes to the SQL in the models folder to adjust for the flavor of SQL of your target database. Definitely consider this if you are using a community-contributed adapter.

8. Test the output of the models:
```bash
$ dbt test
```

9. Generate documentation for the project:
```bash
$ dbt docs generate
```

10. View the documentation for the project:
```bash
$ dbt docs serve
```

### What is a jaffle?
A jaffle is a toasted sandwich with crimped, sealed edges. Invented in Bondi in 1949, the humble jaffle is an Australian classic. The sealed edges allow jaffle-eaters to enjoy liquid fillings inside the sandwich, which reach temperatures close to the core of the earth during cooking. Often consumed at home after a night out, the most classic filling is tinned spaghetti, while my personal favourite is leftover beef stew with melted cheese.
